#The first hash is based on a new way of creating a hash using a symbol
#As such, a symbol :x is set to the value of "some value"

#The second hash uses the variable x instead as the key "hi there" with a value of
#"some value". The old method of creating a hash requires the user to explicitly
#input the colon for a symbol value
